Introduction
============

This summer I met some guys on the UMD subreddit (http://reddit.com/r/umd) who
were looking to put together a team for the UMD Hackathon this September. I'm
a code-minded man, so I decided I wanted in! Everyone else on the team knew and
used Git exclusively, but I only knew SVN. I'd been meaning to learn Git, so I
decided this was as good a time as any.

Tasty Cakes is a bakery in San Francisco, CA with a little problem: their cakes
are to DIE for, but they have very few customers because they don't have a
website! In exchange for getting them online, they've offered me a lifetime
supply of free cakes. I think this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship.
